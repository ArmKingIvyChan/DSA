Files for FIPS 186-3 DSA

1. The file REQUEST.txt contains the range of N,L

2. The file RESPONE.txt contains domain parameter generation and verification, which includes p(the prime modulus),q
(the prime divisor of p-1),Seed (the seed used to generate q), counter(the value of the counter output from the
generation of p), g (a group element of order q), and h(the value used to generate g), key pair generation, signature
generation and verification.

3. The file FAX.txt contains values for DSA signature generation with the
following additional values needed to calculate r and s as in Section 5:
	a. 'x' -- The private key.

	b. 'k' -- A randomly-generated parameter, unique for each message, used to
	compute r and s.  See Section 4 and Appendix 3 for more information on k.

To run this file:

1. Message file should be at the same directory path as DSS.java file

2. Before run this program, key in command:
javac DSS.java
to compile this java file.

2. The command should follow the rules as:
java DSS -p <size_in_bits_of_p> -q <size_in_bits_q> -S <secret_key_file> -P <public_key_file>
java DSS -M messagefile -S secret_key_file -s signature_file
java DSS -M messagefile -P public_key_file -s signature_file
